# Automated Acceptance Testing for Industrial Robots

Industrial robotic systems (IRS) are systems composed of industrial robots that automate industrial processes. They execute repetitive tasks with high accuracy, replacing or supporting dangerous jobs. Consequently, a low failure rate is crucial in IRS. 

Thus, we propose an approach that adapts and apply Automated Acceptance Testing (AAT)  for industrial robotic systems.

On this repository you will have access for the code used in our experiments that was illustrated by two case studies: CS1 and CS2

In each CS there is a README.md to help you to execute the CS and also a video to illustrate the experimentation without our approach (Case Study 1) and 
with our approach (Case Study 2).
